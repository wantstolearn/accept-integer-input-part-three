accept-integer-input-part-three
===============================

Building on the previous:

1) The main user survey section is treated as a method

2) If statment added in the UNTIL to warn user that they have only one attempt left, after making multiple  incorrect inputs

3) Main program starts with a question, and allows the user to decline to take part in the survey

4) Case statement with a list of allowed user input is added (eg 'yes' 'yep' are good answers)

5) Main program has another "prompt" created (prompt1) becasue the "prompt" variable is only allwoed inside the method.
